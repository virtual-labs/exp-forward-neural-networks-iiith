- Variation of error as a function of time-step/epoch <br>
  (a) Observe the variation in case of pattern mode and batch mode. In the former case, the variation of error would be less smoother than in the latter case. <br>
  (b) In each case, observe the number of epochs required for the error to converge to a given value.
- Convergence of weight values <br>
  (a) Observe the plot of individual weight values as functions of time-step/epoch. Each weight value may converge over time, or oscillate within limits, indicating that it is near a minimum in the error surface. <br>
  (b) Observe the number of epochs required for convergence in the case of pattern mode and batch mode. <br>
- Cross-validation <br>
  (a) For the subset of input patterns, observe the values of the corresponding outputs, and compare the obtained outputs with desired outputs. What is the error between the two? <br>
  (b) Is the cross-validation error lesser for batch mode or for the pattern mode?
